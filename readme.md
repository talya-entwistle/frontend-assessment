Here's my completed exercises! Just in case there's an issues with the files I've uploaded exercise 1 to my own repo here:

Exercise 1: https://talya-entwistle.github.io/MindArc-Exercise-1/

Unfortunately GitHub didn't like how many files were a part of exercise 2 so I couldn't upload that one. Hopefully there's no issues viewing it from here but if there is please let me know.

I should note here that this is my first time using Vue.js so a few things may not be working in the most optimal way possible as I was just trying to get the hang of it. Notably the fact that I have JavaScript in the Main.js file (or that I'm using JavaScript at all). But I wanted to at least give it a go! 

Any feedback is welcome :-)
