Here's my completed exercises! Just in case there's an issues with the files I've uploaded exercise 1 to my own repo here:

Exercise 1: https://talya-entwistle.github.io/MindArc-Exercise-1/

Unfortunately GitHub didn't like how many files were a part of exercise 2 so I couldn't upload that one. Hopefully there's no issues viewing it from here but if there is please let me know.

I should note here that this is my first time using Vue.js so a few things may not be working in the most optimal way possible as I was just trying to get the hang of it. Notably the fact that I have JavaScript in the Main.js file (or that I'm using JavaScript at all). But I wanted to at least give it a go! 

Any feedback is welcome :-)

Also, the answer to: "Explain why the result of ```('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()``` is banana"

I admit I did a cheeky Google for this one but the answer was very interesting.

The regular '+' signs add the letters together as normal, however the second '+' in "'a'+ + 'a'" is attempting to convert 'a' into a number. 'a' of course isn't a number so it returns 'NaN' (not a number) instead. Then the final character 'a' is added to spell baNaNa. I didn't realise it's actually the same logic behind 'value++' which is neat to know.
